## Demo

You can play the game [here](https://pkbreakout.netlify.app).

## ToDo:

- Make the game mobile responsive
- Stop the annoying zoom on phones when you're tapping the ass out of the buttons
- Tidy up the CSS, decide on an official _theme_, so to speak (_I'm lowkey an artsy kinda dude it's a pisces thing lol_)
- Implement that cool _InnitToWinnit_ idea I had for the game difficulty like Lauren was saying
- Review the speed & timings with some other people _just in case_ they're still off...

## Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Each level increases in difficulty, challenging the player to adapt and improve.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on both desktop and mobile devices with touch and keyboard controls (_hey I said playable_).
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score, displaying it in real-time.
- **Level Progression**: Displays the current level, with each new level introducing more blocks to break.
- **Game Over Detection**: Alerts the player when the game is over and allows them to restart or submit their score.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Praeda822/pkbreakoutgame.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd pkbreakoutgame
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: For now, the game starts automatically upon loading the page. The ball will begin moving, and it's your job to prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen, so keep up!

2. **Control the Paddle**: Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle. On mobile devices, use the touch controls displayed on the screen.

3. **Break Blocks**: Direct the ball to collide with blocks, breaking them and earning points.

4. **Don't Get Overwhelmed!**: New rows of blocks will spawn in as you play the game, fortunately the ball _also_ breaks blocks on their respective top side! Watch for the bounce!

5. **Advance Levels**: Once all blocks are cleared, the game advances to the next level with increased difficulty.

6. **Avoid dropping the Ball**: If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends. The game will also end if the ball gets stuck in a loop; in this case, manually restart the game by refreshing your page until I fix it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game's interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game's appearance.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For game logic and interactivity.
