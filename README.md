# PKs Breakout Game

<br>

## Overview

PKs Breakout Game is a modern take on the classic arcade game, _Breakout_. Developed only using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, this game challenges players to break blocks by bouncing a ball off a paddle they control. With each level, the game increases in speed and difficulty, testing the player's reflexes and strategy.

## Features

Dynamic Levels: Each level increases in difficulty, challenging the player to adapt and improve.
Responsive Design: Playable on both desktop and mobile devices with touch and keyboard controls.
Score Tracking: Keeps track of the player's score, displaying it in real-time.
Level Progression: Displays the current level, with each new level introducing more blocks to break.
Game Over Detection: Alerts the player when the game is over and allows them to restart or submit their score.
How to Play
Start the Game: The game starts automatically upon loading the page. The ball begins moving, and it's your job to prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen.
Control the Paddle: Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle. On mobile devices, use the touch controls displayed on the screen.
Break Blocks: Direct the ball to collide with blocks, breaking them and earning points.
Advance Levels: Once all blocks are cleared, the game advances to the next level with increased difficulty.
Avoid Losing the Ball: If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends. The game also ends if the ball gets stuck in a loop; in this case, manually restart the game.
Installation
No installation is required. Simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser to start playing.
