## Features

- **Dynamic Levels**: Each level increases in difficulty, challenging the player to adapt and improve.

- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score, displaying it in real-time.
- **Level Progression**: Displays the current level, with each new level introducing more blocks to break.
- **Game Over Detection**: Alerts the player when the game is over and allows them to restart or submit their score.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/breakout-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd breakout-game
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: For now, the game starts automatically upon loading the page. The ball will begin moving, and it's your job to prevent it from falling off the bottom of the screen, so keep up!

2. **Control the Paddle**: Use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move the paddle. On mobile devices, use the touch controls displayed on the screen.

3. **Break Blocks**: Direct the ball to collide with blocks, breaking them and earning points.

4. **Advance Levels**: Once all blocks are cleared, the game advances to the next level with increased difficulty.

5. **Avoid dropping the Ball**: If the ball falls below the paddle, the game ends. The game will also end if the ball gets stuck in a loop; in this case, manually restart the game by refreshing your page until I fix it.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the game's interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling the game's appearance.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For game logic and interactivity.
